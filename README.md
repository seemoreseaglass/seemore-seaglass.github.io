# FAQ
## Technical skills
I am proficient in Python and SQL, and I'm capable to code in JavaScript and HTML/CSS.


## Problem-solving abilities
I approach problems by taking a bird's eye view and asking myself as many questions about the problem as possible before diving into the actual work. When it comes to coding, I begin by outlining the application I'm building and commenting on the steps involved. Additionally, I utilize ChatGPT to gain a better understanding of domains that are unfamiliar to me.

### Coding experienceüë®‚Äçüíª
I studied basic computer science and programming (C, Python, SQL, JavaScript, HTML/CSS) in CS50. Please review [my projects](#project) to gain a better understanding of my practical experience.


## Communication and teamwork
Through my experiences as a project manager and technical support professional, I have learned the following:
- Explicit is better than implicit: I always make sure that my language is clear and explicit, and I actively ask people about their intentions to avoid any misunderstandings.
- Understanding stakeholder workflows: This knowledge is valuable for proactive communication and action.
- Being a motivator: I start by acknowledging the team members' work, especially when initiating discussions.


## Cultural fit
I have actively sought out problems in my previous workplaces and worked towards their resolution through collaboration. Therefore, I am eager to work in an environment that encourages proactiveness. I also believe that excessive top-down decision-making can negatively impact an organization. I appreciate a culture where good ideas, regardless of their source, are welcomed and implemented, much like on Stack Overflow.


## Learning and adaptability
I am a proactive self-learner and I am always open to acquiring new knowledge of libraries and languages when necessary. When exploring new libraries and languages, I prefer to dive in and gain hands-on experience. For questions, I rely on both ChatGPT and web searches, but I understand the importance of referring to original documentation to gain a deeper understanding.
